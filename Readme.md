# Pokédex with React
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies: 
This page has been created with the React library using the HTML, CSS and Javascript protocols and languages. 

For data collection a Pokemon API has been used. [API to Pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-form).

To make the code more readable, we have chosen to work with components and React routing pages system.

## Getting started:

`git clone git@github.com:a-mar-se/React-to-Pokemon-APIS.git

cd React-to-Pokemon-APIS

yarn

yarn start # open localhost:3000`

## How to run

## Next steps
- Better CSS communication between pages using SASS.
- Combine the selection made initially to be able to return data in the pokédex with queries to the API.
- Add the complete Pokédex with all Pókemon (yes, the 802 for actually) into a interactive list with buttons for generation, type, and alphabetic order.
- Emulate game system with a logic for life and probablity for capture equal at Game Boy system.
- Show collected Pokemon on the Pokedex page.
  

## Actual problems without resolution
- CSS is not defined like our first thought, and we expected doing a better conection for futures projects like we said in Next Steps.
- There is a notable difference between the wireframe that we initially thought and what we have achieved
- Improve and include more animations. 
- A responsive design for enjouy our web with the mobile also.
- The collection musn't reset when we refresh the page.
